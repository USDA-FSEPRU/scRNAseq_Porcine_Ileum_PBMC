The empty folders are paths that are used or created in my scripts and Rmd files


Problems:  
All data referenced in the scripts should probably be relative project paths.
Currently we have many absolute paths.
Ideally we would have a 'data' folder and a script that would fetch the data from 
AgDataCommons and put it in the right location in the project.  

Absolute paths in 05_GO_enrich.R that should probably be fixed
